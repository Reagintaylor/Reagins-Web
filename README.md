# Reagins-Web

## Description
- My website is aimed towards employers so that they can view my projects, and full stack experience.
- Employers will be able to get a quick introduction and a glimpse into my background.
- Employers will also be able to contact me quickly and easily. 
- Building this website has helped me get a better understanding of HTML and CSS and has given me the perfect opportunity to showcase what I know so far.
- As time goes on, I plan on implementing more features that directly reflect where I am in my learning of Fullstack.
