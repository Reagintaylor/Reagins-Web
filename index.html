                <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Reagin Turner and I am a full stack web engineer. My dream job would be to work for
                a company who values a good work-life balance. Currently, I live
                in Atlanta, GA and I'm currently a paraeducator in the Dekalb County School System. My hobbies include:</p>

            For this project, me and my group members designed a party planning app. This app allows the user to pick the music, food, activities, and decorations for their party. Some technologies we used were Javascript, Handlebars, and a touch of CSS.

            <details>For this project I worked with my teammate Sistania Bong to create a meal prep website that helps you save recipes to cook when you're ready. Some cool features that we added were checkboxes to help the user keep track of where they are in the recipe. Also, we added a nutrition checker so that the user can be aware of how much they are eating.

            <details>
                My work day scheduler was a really interesting project to work on. It was cool figuring out how to get it to work. There are still some things that still need to be fixed but since the coding was advanced, I'm still proud that I got it to work somewhat.
