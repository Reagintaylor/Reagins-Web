                <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Reagin Turner and I am an 
                aspiring software engineer. My dream job would be to work for
                a company who values a good work-life balance. Currently, I live
                in Atlanta, GA and I teach kindergarten. My hobbies include:</p>

                <h1>🕷My Intentions</h1>
                <p> My intentions of this website are to showcase my abilities 
                    as it relates to the various different coding languages,programs
                    and digital literacy. I hope that you can clearly see my progress 
                    and how fast I am able to learn. </p>

            <details>
            For this project, the website was missing a lot of accessible features.
            I went in and added the alt attribute to the images, and a more descriptive
            title. I also changed the generic div and span tags to semantic tags.
            Lastly, I condensed the CSS style sheet a little so that it wouldn't be so
            repetitive.

            <details>For this project I worked with my teammate Sistania Bong to create a meal prep website that helps you save recipes to cook when you're ready. Some cool features that we added were checkboxes to help the user keep track of where they are in the recipe. Also, we added a nutrition checker so that the user can be aware of how much they are eating.

            <details>
                My work day scheduler was a really interesting project to work on. It was cool figuring out how to get it to work. There are still some things that still need to be fixed but since the coding was advanced, I'm still proud that I got it to work somewhat.
